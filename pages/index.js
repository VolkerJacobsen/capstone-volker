              Founded in 2023, we are still in our infancy, but we are firmly
              convinced that we are stronger together. Especially in a big city
              like Berlin, which can seem cold and harsh, we should approach and
              support each other.
            </p>

              orientation. We also expect this openness from our users. If you
